1) There are no validations on Tags
2) There are no validations on Statuses
3) There are no validations on Categories
4) Any value can be null
5) Post and put work edentical(that's why I haven't created all checks for put), would ask if it is expected
6) Cannot update pet by id with null/empty name/status
7) uploaded images are not saved to photoUrls


Found bugs:
- FindByStatus does not search by multiple status;
- FindByStatus is case sensetive;
- When I specify id negative, zero, long, response returns me another id, but if I do get after that, I get a correct id
- For longs, negative values Post returns different id
- I can upload a file for not existed pet

// Not done
 - Invalid input (returns 500)
 - id longer than long;
